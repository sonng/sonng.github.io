Yeah.. I'm going to leave that title. Just for sentimental value when I start posting more stuff. Just so I can look back, see this post and think to myself, "Oh the memories". Before I begin, I must state the following: this post is the first and probably my last post. There, I said it.

I know what you're thinking. Wtf just happened?<sup>1</sup>

Let me give you a bit of history. I've started many sites like this, only to write up a couple of posts and then finally letting it die. But this year is different. This year I plan on being more productive (at home).

So as part of my new years resolution. I plan on starting a couple of things;

- Start a blog
- Start a pet project
- Start a book

# Start a blog
Why start now? A long time ago, maybe 2009? I started a blog like this. I wrote about random stuff. Stuff like "Oh hey Opera changed their UI"<sup>2</sup>, or "Look at this random thing, it's remotely interesting". It wasn't the best material but hey, I started. This time though it's going to be different.

The difference between now and then, is that back then, whenever I started these things, I never had a goal in mind. Not even a direction. This time however, I have a plan. . At least I have a plan. See, most of this blog would be about my pet project.

Yep, this is the whole reason for the blog. I plan to document my thoughts, my research, my.. everything (maybe not)? Mind you, although I will be posting mostly about my pet project and maybe some technical stuff, I don't intend this to be _**professional**_ and _**serious**_. I'm leaning more towards _**informative**_ and _**fun**_.

So I would like to introduce...

# Start a pet project
JARVIS. Yeah. You know it, I named it JARVIS. I gave it this name for a couple of reasons:

  1. I like the AI in Iron Man
  2. I'm interested in AI
  3. My pet project is going to be an AI

I'm going to come clean. I know next to nothing about AI. I don't know how I'm going to start this, but this is why I think this is going to be fun! My intention is to start small. Maybe something text based. Could hook it up to services like IFTTT. I'll see where this takes me though.

# Start a book
I've started a book series called 'The Stormlight Archive'. I've read the first and second book in the series. Unfortunately the author hasn't finished writing the third book, so I'm waiting for it. I probably try find another book series, hopefully one where there's heaps of books.

Well then.
